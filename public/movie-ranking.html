<h1>The Best Sitcoms According To Peter</h1>

<h2>My top 3 sitcoms of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Big Bang Theory</h3>
<P>This sitcom has everything packed in it. With the storyline filled with lots of laughter and some parts sorrow, it brings in the best of me in thinking of the briliant minds that i wish that could be me.</P>

<h3>How I Met Your Mother</h3>
<P>I just like the way this sitcom played out. The narration of it about the life of the narrator was very interesting. Making the story packed with lots of different adventures on the road of finding the mother of his kids.</P>

<h3>Fresh Prince From Bel-air</h3>
<P>This is a remarkable story of a young person who was used in living the streets to living with his Uncle in a big mansion. The sitcom is filled with laughter and all drama. The transformation of the young person was also one of a deal breaker, from a ganster to responsible person.</P>
